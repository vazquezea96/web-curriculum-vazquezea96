##### Unit 1: Introduction to Web Accessibility

In the first lesson, "What is Web Accessibility?", the focus is on laying the foundation for understanding web accessibility. This encompasses its definition, why it's important, and the legal guidelines that mandate it. The lesson also delves into the business advantages of making web content accessible, highlights the moral obligation to make the web inclusive, and introduces the concept of inclusive design. The second lesson, "Key Principles of Accessibility," takes a deeper dive into the core tenets that guide accessible web design and development. It introduces the POUR principles, which stand for Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust, and emphasizes the need for creating websites that are accessible to all. This lesson also discusses the nuances between usability and accessibility, outlines various types of disabilities that accessibility measures aim to address, and introduces assistive technologies used to improve web accessibility. Together, these lessons provide a comprehensive introduction to the essential topics in web accessibility.

##### Unit 2: Text and Media Accessibility

The lesson on "Text Accessibility" zeroes in on key elements that help make text-based web content more accessible. This includes appropriate use of headings to establish content hierarchy, employing lists for better organization of information, and optimizing links for clear navigation. It also emphasizes the importance of using semantic HTML tags for better screen reader compatibility and selecting fonts that are easily readable across different devices and user settings. Following that, the "Media Accessibility" lesson shifts the focus to non-text elements like images, videos, and audio. The lesson details the necessity of providing alternative text for images, adding captions to videos, and making transcripts available for audio content. It also explains how to make tables accessible, ensuring that data is easily understandable for everyone, including those using assistive technologies. These lessons offer a thorough guide to making both text and media elements on web pages accessible to a diverse audience.

##### Unit 3: Navigational and Interaction Accessibility

The "Keyboard Accessibility" lesson concentrates on creating a navigable and interactive experience for users who rely solely on keyboards. Key elements like tab order for logical flow, custom keyboard shortcuts for enhanced functionality, focus states for indicating active elements, and the use of ARIA roles for semantic clarity are covered. This lesson ensures that web interfaces are operable even without a mouse. The subsequent lesson on "Forms and Inputs" tackles the critical elements that make web forms accessible. This includes proper labeling for form elements, the use of fieldsets to group related items, creating clear and helpful validation messages, and ensuring dropdown menus are accessible. The aim is to provide a seamless and inclusive experience for all users when they interact with web forms, whether they are using assistive technologies or not. These lessons collectively address the vital aspects of web interactivity and data input, making them indispensable for any inclusive web development project.

##### Unit 4: Visual Accessibility

The "Color and Contrast" lesson digs into the visual aspects of web accessibility, exploring how color choices can affect readability and user experience. The lesson educates on the basics of color theory to set the stage for more inclusive design decisions, explains the importance of maintaining adequate contrast ratios as per WCAG guidelines, and introduces tools that can assist in checking whether a design meets contrast standards. Following this, the "Responsive and Mobile Accessibility" lesson broadens the scope to consider how web content behaves across various devices. It covers the use of media queries to adapt layouts, the implementation of flexible grids for a fluid design, the need for accessible navigation menus, and the importance of adequately sized touch targets for mobile interfaces. Together, these lessons equip developers with the knowledge to make visually appealing yet accessible web interfaces that work seamlessly across a multitude of devices and user settings.

##### Unit 5: Advanced Topics

The "ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)" lesson provides an in-depth look at ARIA, a vital toolkit for enhancing web accessibility. This lesson explains what ARIA is and its significance in creating more accessible web content and applications. It goes on to detail how to effectively utilize roles, states, and properties to enrich HTML semantics and improve user experience. Additionally, ARIA landmarks are discussed, which help users with screen readers navigate more effortlessly through the web content. Following this, the "Testing for Accessibility" lesson equips you with practical strategies for evaluating web accessibility. It introduces methods for manual testing, such as keyboard navigation and visual inspection, as well as automated tools like WAVE and Axe. The lesson also highlights different types of screen readers and how to test with them, and emphasizes the importance of compiling comprehensive reports to document any accessibility issues. Collectively, these lessons give a rounded understanding of how to implement and test for web accessibility.

##### Unit 6: Best Practices and Case Studies

The "Best Practices" lesson aims to provide practical, actionable steps to improve web accessibility quickly and effectively. It outlines "Quick Wins"â€”easy, immediate fixes like adding alt text to images or using semantic HTML. These are contrasted with "Long-term Strategies" that require a more sustained effort, such as incorporating inclusive design from a project's inception or scheduling regular accessibility audits. Then, the "Real-world Case Studies" lesson takes a more empirical approach by looking at actual examples. It highlights "Success Stories" of companies that have reaped benefits from making their websites more accessible. Conversely, "Lessons Learned" details cautionary tales of companies that faced legal repercussions due to inadequate web accessibility. This section also covers the "ROI of Accessibility," showing that beyond being a moral and legal obligation, web accessibility can offer a significant return on investment. Together, these lessons offer both the tactical and strategic, underpinned by real-world evidence, to make a compelling case for web accessibility.

##### Unit 7: Project Time

The "Auditing Your VWC Prework Webpage" lesson kicks off the hands-on phase, guiding you through the initial steps of auditing your web project for accessibility. You'll learn how to leverage automated tools like WAVE and Axe for a quick overview of existing issues, as well as how to perform manual checks, such as keyboard navigation tests and visual inspections. Following the audit, the "Implementing Fixes" lesson dives into the nitty-gritty of actually addressing the identified issues. This covers tweaking your HTML semantics for better structure, adding ARIA landmarks to assist with navigation, and ensuring your text and colors meet contrast standards for readability. Once the fixes are in place, the "Final Review and Next Steps" lesson directs you through the wrap-up stages. Here, you'll use debugging tools to catch any last-minute issues, conduct final tests to ensure you've nailed down all the accessibility requirements, and then deploy your updates. You'll also get a list of additional resources for further learning. Finally, a hearty congratulations for completing the project, certifying your skills in making web content more accessible.
