Task 1: Trace back to the initial concept of the CLI: Identify the first systems that used command-line interfaces:

Back in the day there was a paradigm called "Batch Processing. Which was stacks of data and program code in the form of punched cards and it was loaded into a system, and after execution, punched cards containing the results of the computation would be spit out by the machine. The purpose of batch processing was to prepare the complete input dataset and the program code by hand and feed it to the machine in a batch. 
And as time progressed, the teletypewriter (TTY) was born. Computers would take input and produce human-readable output interactively through a typewriter-like device. After TTYs they were later upgraded to text display devices with electronic keyboards that would later be called command-line interface, and it worked as follows:
1. The system prompts the user to type a sentence (a command line)
2. The system executes the command, if valid, prints out the results.
3. This sequence repeats indefinitely, and the user conducts their work step by step.

Fun fact: NASA's 1998 Deep Space 1 mission spacecraft had a REPL controlled from Earth, which allowed scientists to troubleshoot a failure in real-time and prevent the mission from failing. 

Common Shells: Bourne Shell, Korn Shell, C Shell,  and BASH (Bourne Again Shell).
Windows: PowerShell and DOS.

Task 2: Identify key milestones:
Bourne Shell:
- Initially started in 1976
- First appearence was in Version 7 Unix
- Supersesed the Marshey Shell.
- Stephen Bourne
- At&t 

Some Variants:
- DMERT Shell
- Korn Shell
- Schily Bourne Shell
  
Relationship to other shells:
- C Shell
- Almquist Shell
- Bash
- rc
- z shell


inovators:
- Louis Pouzin: developed the RUNCOM tool for executing command scripts. 
- Ken Thompson: developed the unix shell v6 in 1971
- macintosh and windows replaced the cli for the gui in the 1980s and 1990s.
- Microsoft released version 1.0 of Windows Powershell.
- MacOS: since 2001 has been based on a unix-like operating system called darwin.z-shell is the default shell for macOS.
- Dennis Ritchie
- Douglas Mcllroy
